# Keyboard Configurations
## Keyboard.io Model 01-Q

I use a Mac laptop, with a Japanese keyboard, so I'm not only getting used to US positioning on the Model 01, but also just the general difference of having thumb keys. 

See the Arduino sketch (the `.ino` file) and the [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/39097ba16c534bcd6bea62bd14683412) raw file in the `Model01` folder.

Here are a few points to make about this layout:

* esc moved to upper left prog key, and put left option where esc was
* tab and backtick keys swapped
* swapped shift and ctrl thumb keys because I was having too much trouble finding shift
* added macro to turn off led effect and assigned to fn-led
* added macro to toggle language IME between English and Japanese
* added a bunch of typically used cmd-x keys to left function, to make it easier to reach them
