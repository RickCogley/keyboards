# Keyboard Configurations
## Keyboard.io Model 01-Q

I use a Mac laptop, with a Japanese keyboard, so I'm not only getting used to US positioning on the Model 01, but also just the general difference of having thumb keys. 

See the Arduino sketch (the `.ino` file) and the [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) raw file in the `Model01` folder of this repository. 

Here are a few points to make about the latest iteration of this layout:

* esc moved to upper left prog key, and put left option where esc was
* tab moved to physical pgup
* shifts on pinkies
* pgup, pgdn, home, end on fn n,m,comma,period
* backspace on physical num
* numlock is fn-any
* added macro to turn off led effect and assigned to fn-led
* added macro to toggle language IME between English and Japanese, assigned to any
* added a bunch of typically used cmd-x keys to left function, to make it easier to reach them
